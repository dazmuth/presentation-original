## Responsive Fonts
This snippet attempts to font sizes, line heights, and vertical block spacing dynamic and based on screen-size. While the snippet is specialized for the Nova output, it could be customized to work in any output, though some work may need to be done for compatibility.

### IMPORTANT
The original purpose of this snippet was to provide a better user experience on very high resolution displays, and thus the "Wide" breakpoint media query value was updated to move beyond a 1080p monitor, so most standard desktop displays will now use the "Normal" breakpoint.

Because some core variables need to be updated, this snippet is not completely isolated, and some variable files will need to be altered.
